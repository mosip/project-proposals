# Project Name
Tuvali - Means a tunnel in [Tamil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language)

# Project Description
This library contains the implementation for Android & IOS for the Openid4BLE specification. It's written in Kotlin & Swift.

# Alignment with the OpenWallet Foundation Mission
This library implements the BLE-based local transfer of Verifiable Presentation (VP). An offline-based mode provides us with the ability to present a VP in many crises and crowded situations, from stadium entries to social benefits in remote areas. This is an important building block for future digital identity wallets to be inclusive. Since it is written in Kotlin & Swift, it can be used widely.
